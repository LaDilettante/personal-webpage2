I am Anh Le, a PhD candidate in Political Economy at Duke University. My work focuses on studying the political economy of development and authoritarianism, using various quantitative methods.

Projects:

   * [Conflict prediction](https://github.com/LaDilettante/conflict_prediction) using Bayesian model selection and boosted classification tree to construct models from 500 variables. Preliminary results show my model beating Lockheed Martin's benchmark ([ICEWS project)](http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/products/W-ICEWS.html).

   * [Data visualization blog](https://paint-by-number.github.io/).

   * [Teaching Assistant webapp](https://github.com/LaDilettante/TA_app) for the R lab that I taught. This Rails app automates deadline announcement, homework submission, and grading (by randomly assigning students to cross-grade). This allows students to see others' code and learn the material better. The site is live [here](https://polsci630.herokuapp.com), but sign-in is required to view students' data.

   * [Scrape Craig's list RSS feed](https://github.com/LaDilettante/craigslist) and update the results in a database. My girlfriend was looking to buy a car on Craig's list, so I wrote these scripts to automate the process.
